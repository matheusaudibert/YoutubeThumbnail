## 🚀 Features

- Captures the latest comment from a YouTube video
- Censures the comment using AI
- Automatically converts this comment into a thumbnail image using javascript and canvas
- Updates the video thumbnail with the selected comment
- Creates an interactive experience where viewers can influence the appearance of the video

## 💻 How It Works

The system monitors comments on your video and, when configured, selects the most recent comment to transform it into a visually appealing thumbnail. This encourages viewers to comment for a chance to see their comment highlighted.
